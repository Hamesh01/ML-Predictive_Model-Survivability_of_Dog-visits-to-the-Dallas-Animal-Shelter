    "The purpose of this project is too construct a predictive model on the likely hood of survival of a dog visit to the Dallas Animal Shelter. The historical data was sourced from the Dallas City website for financial year 2020 from period October 2019 to September 2020. The model findings will help dispel the negative consensus of treatment of Dogs by the shelter from general public and restore faith in the animal shelter as safe reputable shelter. Dallas animal shelter is a public funded by local constituents via local tax collected from the Dallas City council. Over the years the shelter have been marginalize for lack of care of Dogs .The model will  would pin point major causes  that exacerbate death  of dogs during visit and help develop a system in place to help mitigate the likely hood of death."
