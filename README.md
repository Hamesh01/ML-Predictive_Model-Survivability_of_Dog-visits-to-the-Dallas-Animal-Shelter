# ML-Predictive_Model-Survivability_of_Dog_visiting_the_Dallas_Shelter
The purpose of this project is to construct a predictive model on the likely hood of survival of a dog visit to the Dallas Animal Shelter. The historical data was sourced from the Dallas City website for financial year 2020 from period October 2019 to September 2020. The model findings will help dispel the negative consensus of treatment of Dogs by the shelter. Original data set contained over 22,344 visits. I performed exploratory data analysis, feature importance test, feature engineering . I intend to ascertain conditions that contribute to survival& non survival. I applied Logistic Regression ,Gradient Boost, XGBoost for this predictive modeling project .
